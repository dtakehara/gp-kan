### Gaussian Process Kolmogorov Arnold Network

Combines the ideas of Kolmogorow Arnold Network and deep gaussian process networks. Uncertainty propagation across neurons is done via inner product of the input distribution with a function sampled from the neuron's GP, producing a Gaussian output.

Simulations contain a demo on verifying the calculations of a neuron's output, and a demo using a simple model composed of these neurons for MNIST classification
